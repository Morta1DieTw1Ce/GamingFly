      Valorant:Top Tips and Tricks for beginners
    </h3>
    <p style="color:white">
      Valorant has been around for quite some time now, ever since its release in 2020. However, the game is still going stronger than ever, evidenced by the Valorant Mobile game bound for release. However, this doesn’t mean that new players aren’t trying the popular hero-shooter. You’ll find plenty of newcomers to the game, even today. If you count yourself as one of the newcomers to Valorant, we’ll help you get started. In this article, you’ll learn a few essential Valorant tips and tricks to beat the competition.

Valorant‘s shooting mechanics and movement are inspired by Counter-Strike. So, if you’ve played games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the gameplay shouldn’t seem too different to you. Moreover, the movement isn’t as drastically different as the type that you’ll find in Apex Legends. So, the game remains accessible to beginners without taking away the challenge that hooked so many veteran gamers.

Bearing this in mind, let’s look at the Valorant tips and tricks!
    </p>
    <b>
      1.Crouch when facing good players
    </b>
    <p style="color:white">
     The best Valorant players tend to aim for the head. After all, headshots give you a better chance of killing your enemy and getting closer to victory. You have to understand your opponents’ skill levels. If they’re beginners, they will likely aim around your character’s chest. You’ll give them a free headshot at the same level if you crouch. This is why you should stand when facing the newcomers or mediocre players.
    </p>
    <b>
      2.Choose a gun and stick to it
    </b>
    <p style="color:white">
      When you start off the game, you’ll only have your signature pistol and an ability. The more rounds you win, the better rewards you get to purchase better guns in the same match. This mechanic is similar to that of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. When you’ve finally got enough resources to buy a gun, choose your weapon wisely. Moreover, after selecting it, don’t keep purchasing newer guns multiple times.
    </p>
    <b>
      3.Unpredictability is your friend
    </b>
    <p style="color:white">
      If there’s one thing that beginner players at Valorant get wrong, it’s the movement. When you’re moving in-game, you have to be fast and unpredictable. Your movement should be so erratic that most opponents aren’t able to figure out your movement patterns. When you keep moving spontaneously, it will frustrate your opponent. This frustration will lead to lousy aim and constant fire, resulting in gun recoil as well. When you realise that your opponent’s aim is going for a toss, you swoop out of cover and take your shot for the kill. This may take some time to get used to, but it’s one of the best Valorant tips you can find!

      4.Adjusting crosshairs
    </b>
    <p style="color:white">
      Most FPS (first-person shooters) have the option of adjusting mouse sensitivity. While this is an essential option, Valorant also allows you to change your crosshairs. The crosshair is personal to each Valorant gamer and is only changed when you’ve adjusted to the basics of the gunplay. You can change your crosshair once you’ve understood how the gunplay mechanics work. Adjust your crosshairs’ colour, type, and pattern to make them work in your favour. There’s no fixed crosshair that works for every game. This Valorant tip requires you to use the trial and error method to see what works for you. Once you find the perfect crosshairs for your gameplay, you’ll be set for more accurate shots and easier gunplay.
    </p>
    <b>
      5.Equip knife during gun fight
    </b>
    <p style="color:white">
      Gunfights in Valorant can start at any time. However, there are moments in the game where you won’t find any action for quite a while. During these moments, you might have to run towards an objective or to get a better vantage point. If this case arises, ensure that you’ve equipped your knife when running. The knife weighs less and will help you run faster. Remember: even the smallest increase in speed can save you from bullets. We recommend you try this only after you’ve played your first few matches, though. If you’re a complete beginner and try this, you might not be able to equip your gun on time in case a gunfight erupts in front of you.
